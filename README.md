# Pharmaceutical Drug Sales Analysis using Power BI

This project focuses on analyzing pharmaceutical drug sales data both month-wise and year-wise. The dataset was cleaned using Power Query (handling nulls, removing duplicates, fixing errors, and unpivoting columns), and interactive dashboards were built in Power BI.

ðŸ“Š **Dashboards Included**:
- **Monthly Sales Trend (Current Year)**: Visualizes monthly sales patterns, highlighting peak and low-performance periods.
- **Year-wise Comparison**: Compares total sales across different years to identify growth and trends.

The report enables key stakeholders to monitor performance and make data-driven decisions effectively.
